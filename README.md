# TETRIS GAME #
#Game Description:
-Tetris is a tile-matching puzzle game where the player aims to create complete rows of blocks on a grid. The game starts with an empty grid, and different-shaped blocks called figures fall from the top of the grid. The player can move and rotate the figures as they fall, with the goal of arranging them to form complete rows. When a row is completed, it is cleared, and the player earns points.
#How to Play:
1.Use the arrow keys to move the shapes left, right, or down.
2.Use the up arrow key to rotate the shapes.
3.Use the spacebar to drop the shape to the bottom.
4.The main objective of the game is to clear as many lines as possible by filling complete horizontal lines with the figures.
5.Once a line is completed,it will be cleared,and the player will earn points.
6.If one line gets cleared at bottom we get 1 point.
7.The game ends when the shapes stack up to the top(reach the top of the grid).
8.Then press ESC to restart the game.
9.Enjoy playing Tetris!
